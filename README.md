# Foobar
My solutions to the Google Foobar challenge.

Will add individual descriptions later.

Please try to solve the challenge first by yourself, before using this.

I did not copy the exact description of the problems and cannot access them after submitting hte solutions. The challenge has 5 levels with the following number of problems: 1, 2, 3, 2, 1. There is a very generous time limit which goes from 2 days for level 1 to 15 days in level 5. The challenge is not that hard when it comes to programming, all you need is loops and ifs and maybe functions. I don't think I ever needed floats either, all problems are in terms of integers.

For each problem you are to write a function called "solution(input)" which takes the input variable(s) specified in the description and returns the output. It is then run against test cases, 2 open (and often very simple) ones and a number of hidden test cases. If you fail a test case it does not tell you why, but you can make educated guesses. E.g. if your code suddenly fails all test cases, it it most likely an error. 

On some of the higher level problems, a working solution that returns the correct result is not good enough to solve all hidden test cases. It also needs to be a sufficiently fast solution, because runtime is limited. Since it doesn't tell you why your code failed, it took me some time to figure that out.
